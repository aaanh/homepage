    <p>This portfolio is built with ðŸ©¸ and ðŸ˜­.</p>
    <p>I bootstrapped it with <code>npx create-t3-app</code>. Styled with Tailwind, no theme or component libraries were used, unlike the previous incarnation of this portfolio (DaisyUI).</p>
    <p>The site is hosted on Vercel and its source code is on <a href="https://github.com/aaanh/homepage">Github</a></p>
    <p>As you can tell, I shamelessly skadooshed the styles from macOS.</p>
