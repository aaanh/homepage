    <p>Hi, my name is *chicka chicka* Sli-.... Anh, welcome to my portfolio.</p>
    <p>The current iteration of the project was bootstrapped with <code>npx create-next-app</code>, running the bleeding edge Next.js 15 and React 19. Styled with Tailwind.</p>
    <p>The site is hosted on Vercel and its source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/aaanh/homepage">Github</a>.</p>
