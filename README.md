## FAAAAQ

- Any plans to make it more adaptable and template-y and extensible?

  > Would very much love to, but I'm swamped at the moment ðŸ˜µ

- Any plans to make the terminal window movable?

  > Looking into it ðŸ¤”, probably a library from `/pmndrs`

- Can I make it my own?

  > For sure ðŸŽ‰, with attributions (like a line in README.md or something, no need to actually deface your site).

- What if I found a bug that I can fix?
  > Feel free to fork and submit a PR ðŸ˜‰
