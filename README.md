## FAAAAQ

- Any plans to make it more adaptable and template-y and extensible?
> Would very much love to, but I'm swamped at the moment 😵

- Any plans to make the terminal window movable?
> Looking into it 🤔, probably a library from `/pmndrs`

- Can I make it my own?
> For sure 🎉, with attributions (like a line in README.md or something, no need to actually deface your site).

- What if I found a bug that I can fix?
> Feel free to fork and submit a PR 😉
